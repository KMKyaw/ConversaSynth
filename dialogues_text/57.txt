Cathy|Oh my god, have you guys heard the latest meme? It's hilarious! 
Frank|I haven't had a chance to check it out yet. Can you tell me more about it? 
Cathy|Of course! So, there's this one video where a cat is trying to catch a laser pointer and it's just so funny . I can't stop watching it! Have you seen it?
Frank|No, I haven't had the chance yet. But I'm definitely going to check it out now that you've recommended it. Thanks for sharing!
Cathy|Anytime!  And speaking of funny things, have you guys heard about the new comedy show that just started streaming? It's supposed to be really good.
Frank|I haven't had a chance to check it out yet, but I'll definitely add it to my watchlist. Thanks for letting me know! 
Cathy|No problem!  And hey, have you guys tried that new restaurant downtown? It's supposed to be really good and I heard the food is amazing.
Frank|Yeah, I've been wanting to try it out. Can you tell me more about it? What kind of food do they serve? 
Cathy|Oh, it's all kinds of stuff. They have burgers, salads, pasta, and even some vegan options. And the best part is that the portions are huge!  You get a lot for your money.
Frank|That sounds great! I'll definitely give it a try soon. Thanks for the recommendation!
