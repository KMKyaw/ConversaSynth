Eva|So, what's been going on in your life lately?
Cathy|Oh, you know, just the usual. Work, school, hanging out with friends. How about you?
Eva|I've been feeling really overwhelmed with work and personal stuff. It's hard to keep up with everything sometimes.
Cathy|Yeah, I totally get that. But hey, at least we have each other to talk to, right? 
Eva|Exactly! It's nice to have someone to confide in and share my feelings with. 
Cathy|Absolutely! And speaking of sharing, have you seen that new Netflix show everyone's been talking about? 
Eva|Umm, no I haven't actually... 
Cathy|Oh, man! You totally need to watch it! It's hilarious and has the best characters. 
Eva|Hmm, maybe I will give it a try...
