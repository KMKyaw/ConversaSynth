Cathy|Did you guys hear about the new comedy club opening up downtown? It's going to be huge!
Ben|(squinting) Really? I hadn't heard. What makes you say that?
Cathy|Well, I overheard the owner talking to some investors and they said it's going to be a huge hit. Plus, they've already booked some big names for opening night. (giggles) Can you imagine?
Ben|(smiling) That does sound interesting. I'll have to check it out.
Cathy|Oh, totally! You should come with me and we can laugh our heads off together! (winks)
