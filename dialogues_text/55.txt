Eva|I'm so glad we're all here together today. It's been a tough week for me, and I'm grateful for your support.
Alice|Oh no, what happened? We're here for you, Eva!
Cathy|Yeah, tell us everything! We're all ears.
Ben| I'm sure Eva will appreciate the attention, but I'm more interested in hearing about your latest book find, Ben.
Eva| Thank you, Ben. I just need to vent sometimes. It's been a rough few days, and I could use some cheering up.
Alice| Well, we're here for you! We'll cheer you up in no time.
Cathy| And maybe we can even get Ben to tell us a funny story or two. He's always got some great tales to share.
Ben| Indeed, I do have a few amusing anecdotes up my sleeve.
Eva| Thank you all for being here for me. It means so much.
