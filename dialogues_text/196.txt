Cathy|So, Alice, what's been the highlight of your week?
Alice|Oh, you know, just the usual adventures. I went skydiving for the first time and it was amazing!
Cathy|Oh my god, that's incredible! I could never do something like that. I get too scared. But hey, more power to you!
Alice|Yeah, I know, it's not everyone's cup of tea. But I love the rush of adrenaline and the feeling of accomplishment afterward.
Cathy|Well, I'm glad you're living your best life, Alice! You're always doing something exciting.
Alice|Thanks, Cathy! You're pretty funny yourself. What have you been up to lately?
