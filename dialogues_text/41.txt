Ben|I've been reading this book on quantum physics and it's really opened my eyes to the complexity of the universe.
David|Wow, that's fascinating! I've always been interested in science, but I never knew much about quantum physics. Can you tell me more?
Ben|Sure, it's a really interesting field. The way particles can be in multiple places at once and the concept of entanglement... it's mind-blowing.
David|Yeah, I can see why you're so intrigued by it. It's like a whole other world.
Ben|Exactly! And there's so much we still don't understand.
David|I know, right? It's like the universe is full of secrets and mysteries just waiting to be uncovered.
Ben|Absolutely. I could spend hours lost in thought about it.
David|Me too! It's like my mind is constantly racing with ideas and theories.
