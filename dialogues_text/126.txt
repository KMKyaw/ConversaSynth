Cathy|So, Ben, have you read any good books lately? I'm always looking for new recommendations.
Ben|Actually, I just finished reading "The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao" by Junot DÃ­az. It was incredible. Have you read it?
Cathy|No, I haven't, but it sounds interesting. I love getting lost in a good book.
Ben|Me too! There's nothing like escaping into a different world for a while.
