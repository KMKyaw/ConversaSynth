David|I've been thinking a lot about my creative pursuits lately. The world needs more imagination and art, don't you think?
Cathy|(laughs) Oh, David, you and your dreamy ideas!  But seriously, how can we make the world a better place through art?
Henry|(interrupting) Excuse me, but have either of you heard about the new historical findings on ancient civilizations? It's fascinating! 
David|(losing focus) Oh, wow, Henry, that sounds really interesting! I'm all ears! 
Cathy|(rolling her eyes) David, you're always lost in your own world. Can we talk about something practical for once? Like, how can we make a profit from our creative talents?
Henry|(chuckles) Ah, Cathy, you always bring us back to reality!  But seriously, I think we should explore crowdfunding platforms to fund our projects. What do you think, David?
David|(absently) Oh, yeah, that's a great idea!  Or maybe we could start a Kickstarter campaign for my latest novel...
Cathy|(exasperated) David, focus! We need to come up with a solid plan to make money off our talents.
Henry|(nodding) Absolutely. I think we should brainstorm some ideas and see what works best for each of us. 
David|(inspired) Oh, that's a great idea! We could have a creative jam session and come up with something amazing together! 
Cathy|(sighs) I just hope we can make some money off this... 
Henry|(encouragingly) Don't worry, Cathy. With our combined talents and creativity, we can definitely make something special happen!
