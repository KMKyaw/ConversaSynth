Isabella|I've been brainstorming new ideas for our company's marketing strategy. Have you seen the latest trends in digital advertising?
David|Oh, wow! That sounds really interesting!  Can you tell me more about it? 
Isabella|Of course!  There are so many innovative ways to reach our target audience nowadays. We could try using virtual reality in our ads, or even create an augmented reality app for customers to interact with our products. The possibilities are endless! 
David| Wow, that would be amazing!  I can just see it now – customers walking around with our products superimposed onto their surroundings in real-time... 
Isabella| You're so creative, David!  But seriously, we need to start thinking outside the box if we want to stay ahead of the competition. 
David| Oh, definitely!  I have a few ideas myself – what do you think about using 3D printing to create customized product designs? Or even collaborating with influencers on social media to reach a wider audience... 
Isabella| Oh, wow! That's really clever!  I can see how that could work. We should definitely look into those options.
