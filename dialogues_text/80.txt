Ben|I've been thinking a lot about my childhood lately. It was... complicated.
Eva|Oh, Ben? What do you mean?
Ben|Well, my parents were always fighting when I was growing up. It was like this constant background noise that I couldn't escape.
Eva| I can imagine that would be really tough to deal with. Did it affect your self-esteem or how you saw yourself?
Ben|Yeah, definitely. I always felt like I was the problem, like there was something wrong with me. It took me a long time to realize that they were the ones with the issues, not me.
Eva|That must have been really hard for you. But you're so intelligent and thoughtful, Ben. You deserve to be happy and content.
Ben|Thanks, Eva. Just talking about it feels like a weight off my shoulders.
