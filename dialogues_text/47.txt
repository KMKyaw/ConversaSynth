Frank|I've been meaning to start a new workout routine. Have any of you guys tried that new fitness app?
Ben|Yeah, I've heard good things about it. I'm actually planning on trying it out this weekend.
Sarah|Oh, cool! I've been meaning to get back into yoga. Maybe I'll try that instead.
Mike|Yeah, there are a lot of great options out there. I've been doing some research and I think I'm going to try a combination of strength training and cardio.
Frank|That sounds like a good plan. I've found that mixing it up keeps things interesting and prevents plateaus.
Ben|Absolutely. And it's important to listen to your body and adjust your routine accordingly.
Sarah|Definitely. I'm going to try to do at least one yoga class a week, and see how that goes.
Mike|Yeah, consistency is key. I'm going to aim for at least three times a week for strength training and cardio.
