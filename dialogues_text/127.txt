Cathy|So, what's the plan for today? Should we hit the beach or go hiking?
Grace|Hmm, I think I'd prefer to stay in and tend to my garden. It's been a while since I've seen those flowers bloom.
Alice|Oh, come on! Don't be such a party pooper, Grace. We should go explore the new hiking trail that just opened up. It'll be an adventure!
Cathy|(laughs) Oh, Alice, you always know how to bring the fun. But, Grace, don't worry, we can always come back and visit your garden later. Maybe next time.
Grace|(smiling) Thank you, Cathy. I think I will enjoy it when it's not too hot outside.
Alice|(excitedly) Oh, perfect! Let's go! Who's coming with me?
Cathy|(chuckles) Well, since you asked... I'm in. Get your hiking boots ready, Grace!
Grace|(laughs) Oh, dear. I think I will need my water bottle and sunscreen at least.
