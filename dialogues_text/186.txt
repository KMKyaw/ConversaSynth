Grace|I've been thinking about starting a vegetable garden in my backyard. Have any of you ever tried it?
Frank|Oh, absolutely! I have a green thumb, you know.  I find it so relaxing to tend to my plants. It's like therapy for me.
Grace| Yes, I can imagine. There's something so satisfying about watching something you planted grow and flourish.
