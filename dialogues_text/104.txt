Eva|I've been feeling really stressed out lately. I don't know how much more of this I can take.
Cathy|Oh no, Eva! What's going on?
Emily|Yeah, you can totally tell when someone's not doing well. You're so supportive and nurturing, Eva. We're all here for you.
Jack|And we'll all help you through this tough time. Just let us know what we can do to help.
Eva|It's just...life, I guess. Work has been crazy and my personal life is kind of a mess. I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this.
Cathy|Aww, Eva! Life can be tough sometimes. But you know what they say, when life gives you lemons...
Emily|Yeah, make lemonade! Or in your case, maybe just a nice cup of tea to calm yourself down?
Jack|Exactly! And we're all here for you, Eva. You're not alone in this. We'll get through it together.
Eva|Thank you...I appreciate that.  I don't know what to do.
Cathy|Well, maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together? Sometimes talking things out can help clarify things.
Emily|Yeah, and sometimes taking a break from everything can be helpful too. Like, going for a walk or reading a book...something that takes your mind off of everything else.
Jack|Absolutely! And don't forget about exercise! Exercise is great for stress relief.
Eva| Yeah, maybe you're right. I just feel so stuck and unsure of what to do next.
Cathy|Well, we'll figure it out together. We're all in this together. And hey, at least we have each other! 
Emily|Exactly! And who knows, maybe something good will come out of all of this. Sometimes bad things lead to good things...who knows?!
Jack|Yeah, and sometimes you just have to take a deep breath and let go of everything. Life has its ups and downs, but we'll get through it together.
