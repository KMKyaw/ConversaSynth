Ben| Thank you, Isabella. As an intellectual, I must say that I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. But let's not forget to analyze the practical aspects of this project as well.  What are your thoughts on funding and resources?
David| Good point, Ben. I have thought about that already. I plan to apply for grants and seek out investors who share my vision. And as for resources, I have a few connections in the art world that could help me out.
Alice| Wow, David, you've really thought this through!  I'm sure you'll make it work.
Cathy| Yeah, and if all else fails, we can just throw a big party to fund it. 
Isabella| Now that's a great idea, Cathy!  I think we should all chip in and help David however we can. It's important to support each other's creative endeavors.
Ben| Indeed. As an intellectual, I believe that art is an essential aspect of society, and it's crucial that we encourage and facilitate its creation.  Now, let's brainstorm some more ideas for David's project!
David| Sounds like a plan! Thanks, everyone.  I feel rejuvenated and inspired after this conversation. Let's do it again sometime!
