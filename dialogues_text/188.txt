Alice|I've always wanted to try bungee jumping. Have any of you guys ever done it?
Eva|Oh, no thank you! I don't think I could handle the heights. But hey, if you want to do it, go for it!
Isabella|Actually, I designed a special harness for bungee jumping that's much safer than traditional ones. And I have a great idea for a new app that would make it even more enjoyable!
Alice|That's so cool, Isabella! I would love to try it out.
Eva|Yeah, I can see why you'd want to do something like that, Alice. It's always great to push yourself outside of your comfort zone and try new things.
Isabella|Exactly! And with my design and Isabella's app, it would be a completely different experience.
