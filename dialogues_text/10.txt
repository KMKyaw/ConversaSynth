Cathy|So, what's the plan for tonight?
Isabella|Well, I was thinking we could go to that new restaurant downtown. Have you been there yet, Ben?
Ben|No, I haven't had a chance to try it out yet. How is it?
Cathy|Oh, it's great! The food is amazing, and the atmosphere is really cool.
Isabella|Yeah, I've heard good things about it too. I'm glad we're going there.
Henry|Speaking of food, have you guys tried that new bakery on Main Street? I heard their pastries are to die for.
Cathy|Ooh, I love pastries! Let's go check it out after dinner.
Isabella|Sounds like a plan to me.
Ben|I'm not sure if I can handle another sweet treat tonight...
Henry|Nonsense, Ben! You need to try their famous croissants. They're to die for.
Cathy|Oh, come on Henry! Don't be such a party pooper.
Isabella|Yeah, let's live a little and indulge in some delicious treats!
Ben| Fine... but just one or two.
Henry| Oh, great! Now that we have our plan, let's get going!
