Grace|I've been feeling so calmed lately, ever since I started tending to my garden. It's such a peaceful and nurturing activity for me.
Eva|Oh, I completely understand! I find comfort in supporting others, especially when they're going through difficult times. It brings me joy to be able to provide a listening ear and offer comfort.
Grace|Yes, exactly! And it's amazing how much growth and beauty can come from something as simple as tending to a garden. It's a reminder that life is full of possibilities and growth opportunities.
Eva|Absolutely! I think that's why I'm so drawn to helping others. Seeing the positive impact I can have on someone's life is incredibly rewarding. And it's amazing how much we can learn from each other when we take the time to listen and support one another.
Grace|Yes, exactly! It's all about finding that balance between nurturing ourselves and others. When we take care of ourselves, we're better able to help others, and vice versa.
