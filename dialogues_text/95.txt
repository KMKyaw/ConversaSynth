Ben|I've been reading this book on philosophy, and I must say, it's really made me think about the meaning of life.
Cathy|Oh, wow! That's deep!  Have you come up with any conclusions yet?
Ben|Well, I'm not sure if there's a definitive answer, but it's made me realize that happiness isn't the only thing that matters in life.
Cathy|Haha, yeah! I mean, I love making people laugh, but at the end of the day, it's not everything. 
Ben|Exactly! It's important to find purpose and fulfillment in our lives beyond just seeking happiness.
Cathy|Oh, I couldn't agree more!  There's so much more to life than just being happy all the time.
