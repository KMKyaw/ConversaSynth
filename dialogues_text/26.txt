Isabella|I've been brainstorming some new ideas for a project I want to work on. Have any of you thought about anything interesting lately?
David|Oh, man...I've got so many ideas floating around in my head right now!  Do you guys want to hear them all?
Ben| Go ahead, David. I'm all ears.
Eva| Me too. I love hearing new ideas and perspectives.
David|Okay, so...I was thinking about starting a podcast focused on indie music. And then there's this app idea I have for gamers that would make it easier to connect with other players. Oh, and I also want to write a novel someday... 
Isabella|That's great! I think a podcast could be really fun, David. And the app idea sounds interesting too.  What made you want to start a podcast?
David|Yeah, I just love music and I think it would be awesome to share some of my favorite indie artists with more people. Plus, it'll give me an excuse to geek out about music all the time! 
Ben|That's a great idea, David. I'm always looking for new music to listen to. Maybe you could even interview some of the musicians? 
Eva|Yeah, that would be really cool. You could ask them about their creative process and what inspires them. 
David|Oh, man...I would love that!  Yeah, I'll definitely look into it. Thanks for the suggestions, guys!
