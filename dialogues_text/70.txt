Isabella|I've been thinking about starting a new tech venture. Have any of you guys got any ideas?
Cathy|Oh, wow! That sounds exciting!  What kind of tech are we talking about here?
Diana|Hmm, that's a great idea Isabella! I think it would be really cool if you could create a device that helps people reduce their carbon footprint. 
Jason|Yeah, that's a great idea Diana! And with the current climate crisis, it's super important to do our part in reducing waste and pollution.
Isabella|Exactly! I was thinking of creating a device that monitors energy usage and suggests ways for people to conserve energy in their daily lives. 
Cathy|Oh my gosh, that's amazing! You're so inventive Isabella!  Can I be the one to test it out? 
Diana| Of course, Cathy! We can all help brainstorm and bring this idea to life.
Jason|Absolutely, let's get started on this project! It'll be a great learning experience for all of us.
