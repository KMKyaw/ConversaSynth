Henry|Did you know that the Great Fire of London in 1666 was started by a bakery accident?
Ben|Really? I had no idea. Fascinating!
Henry|Yes, it's amazing how something as simple as a loaf of bread can lead to such a devastating event.
Ben|And have you heard about the Great Plague of London in 1665? It was caused by a rat infestation in the city's sewers.
Henry|Wow, that's incredible! I had no idea there were so many interesting historical events in London.
Ben|Yes, and have you heard about the Tudor dynasty? They were quite fascinating, especially King Henry VIII with his six wives.
Henry|(laughs) Oh, yes! That's a classic story. I could listen to that all day.
