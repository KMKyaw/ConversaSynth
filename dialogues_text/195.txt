Henry|Did you know that the Great Fire of London in 1666 lasted for four days and destroyed nearly 80% of the city?
Ben|Wow, that's fascinating! I had no idea. What sparked it?
Henry|It was a combination of factors, including the narrow streets and wooden buildings, which made it easy for the fire to spread quickly.
Ben|That's so interesting. I bet there are a lot of stories behind that event.
Henry|Oh, definitely. The fire killed thousands of people and left many more homeless. It was a tragic time in history.
Ben|Yeah, I can only imagine how devastating it must have been for the people who lived through it.
Henry|And it's interesting to note that the fire actually helped shape the city's building codes and safety regulations moving forward.
Ben|That's incredible. It's amazing how events in the past can shape our present and future.
Henry|Absolutely. History is full of surprises, and it's important to learn from them.
