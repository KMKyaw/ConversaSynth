{"name": "Ben", "dialogue": "I've read a lot about it, but I haven't actually done it myself. What kind of business are you considering?"}
{"name": "Isabella", "dialogue": "It's an idea I've had for a while now - creating a platform that connects local artists with clients who want unique and personalized pieces."}
{"name": "Ben", "dialogue": "That sounds like a great idea! Have you done any market research to see if there's demand for it?"}
{"name": "Isabella", "dialogue": "Yes, I have. And the feedback has been really positive so far. But I'm worried about how to fund it and make it sustainable."}
{"name": "Ben", "dialogue": "Well, there are a few options you could consider. Have you looked into crowdfunding or angel investors?"}
{"name": "Isabella", "dialogue": "Yes, I have. But I'm not sure if they would be interested in my type of business."}
{"name": "Ben", "dialogue": "I see what you mean. Another option could be to approach local businesses and see if they would be willing to sponsor or partner with your platform."}
