{"name": "Eva", "dialogue": "It's just...life, I guess. Work has been crazy and my personal life is kind of a mess. I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this."}
{"name": "Cathy", "dialogue": "Aww, Eva! Life can be tough sometimes. But you know what they say, when life gives you lemons..."}

{"name": "Jack", "dialogue": "Absolutely! And don't forget about exercise! Exercise is great for stress relief."}
{"name": "Eva", "dialogue": "*nods* Yeah, maybe you're right. I just feel so stuck and unsure of what to do next."}
{"name": "Cathy", "dialogue": "Well, we'll figure it out together. We're all in this together. And hey, at least we have each other! *smiles*"}
{"name": "Emily", "dialogue": "Exactly! And who knows, maybe something good will come out of all of this. Sometimes bad things lead to good things...who knows?!"}
{"name": "Jack", "dialogue": "Yeah, and sometimes you just have to take a deep breath and let go of everything. Life has its ups and downs, but we'll get through it together. *smiles*"}
